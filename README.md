# ArepaZombie's Album Display

Did you hate when you forget what kind albums are you listening to? Did you want to have a "library" when you can save and see some albums and check it when you want too listen to music?

...no? Is only me?

Well anyway... that's this personal project made with Vite, React, the Spotify API and other fetching tools. I want to put myself in new situations and practice with the use of some API.

This app isn't perfect. I want to add some new features in the future but I have to learn some more about server-side and other backen stuff.  For now, I like it and I will use it, even has some errors (that i don't know how to handle without using node) and I only stores in localStorage.

Anyway,I hope someone find this usefull.
